    "details":"Priced at $679,999 the Lamborghini Huracan is a veritable bargain in the world of exotic supercars, and unlike its bigger brother you could drive it every day without shanking your back. Its drop-dead gorgeous interior design and angular bodywork turn the everyday drive into an occasion and a cracking 448kW V10 mechanical beating heart nestled behind the driver ensures it's more than just a pretty face."
